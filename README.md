# Blockchain
Blockchain made with Python

This is a VERY simple, but complete cryptocurrency/blockchain/wallet system. This implementation will not include smart contracts, transaction rewards, nor utilize Merkel trees. Its only purpose is to act as a decentralized ledger. I will eventually fork a few experimental blockchains with advanced features from this one.
